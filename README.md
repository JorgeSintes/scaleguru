# ScaleGuru

ScaleGuru is an application designed for enhancing your musical scale practice, catering to both classical and jazz musicians.
It aims to offer various practice methods that not only instruct you on how to play scales but also guide you on the sequence of practicing them for optimal learning.

This project is a personal endeavor that I'm developing in my free time, both for personal use and to learn the fundamentals of app development.

## Features

ScaleGuru includes two modes to cater to different learning styles and objectives:

-   **Practice Mode**: randomized practice routines for groups of different scales on all 12 keys. Users can select from different presets of scales: classical scales, modes from major, harmonic or melodic minor, scales that fit specific chord types or just select the scales they want to practice. Then they can choose between different ways of randomizing the scales, which will show up hidden by default in order to encourage memory recall. It also includes a playback feature, allowing users to listen to the scale they are supposed to play, aiding in familiarization with its sound.
-   **Inspector mode**: displays whatever scale, with playback functionality. Perfect to experiment and have a quick reference tool.

## Future features

-   [ ] Re-implement using React Native, so it can be ported to an Android app.
-   [ ] Including each scale's chord and displaying it.
-   [ ] Adding a playback of a chord vamp. Would involve familiarizing myself with chord voicings and such.
-   [ ] Include different exercises to play over the scales, and not only upwards-downwards.

## Built Using

ScaleGuru leverages the following libraries to provide an intuitive and efficient user experience:

VexFlow: A JavaScript library for rendering music notation.
PicoCSS: A minimal CSS framework for semantic HTML.
Tone.js: A Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser.
These tools contribute significantly to the functionality and aesthetic of ScaleGuru, enabling dynamic scale visualization, responsive design, and auditory feedback.
