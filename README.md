# ScaleGuru

ScaleGuru is a project designed for enhancing your musical scale practice, catering to both classical and jazz musicians. The primary objective of ScaleMate is to offer various practice methods that not only instruct you on how to play scales but also guide you on the sequence of practicing them for optimal learning.

This project is a personal endeavor that I'm developing in my free time, both for personal use and to learn the fundamentals of app development.
